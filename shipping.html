            <h4>A Few Things to Note</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>The shipping cost you see at checkout covers what Minted and our carriers charge for shipping your order. It does not include duties, taxes, or other customs fees, which are determined by governments in accordance with local laws. If you’re in the U.S. ordering from an international seller in our Third-Party Marketplace, these additional fees may apply. Duties and taxes are collected from you separately, by the carrier and not by Minted.</li>
              <li>This may happen when the package is delivered, or it may be billed to you by the carrier later. In some cases, the carrier may hold the package until import duties are paid. For any additional questions regarding duties and fees, please reach out directly to the carrier.</li>
              <li><a href="https://www.minted.com/contact">Contact us</a> for help shipping to APO / FPO or P.O. Box addresses.</li>
              <li>Shipping times may vary for orders delivered to Alaska or Hawaii. Standard shipping to Alaska and Hawaii is 9 business days.</li>
              <li>We don’t ship with a signature required, but when it comes time to deliver, requiring a signature is at the delivery driver’s discretion.</li>
              <li>Shipping business days are defined as Monday through Friday for Rush, Expedited, and Priority, and Tuesday through Saturday for Standard shipping to residences. Shipping business days exclude New Year’s Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas.</li>
